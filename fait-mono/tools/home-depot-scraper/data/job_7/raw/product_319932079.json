    "description": "ForceField Panels are at the core of the ForceField Weather Barrier System from Georgia-Pacific, the industry leader in building products. This smarter sheathing system for walls and sloped roofs is a faster, easier alternative to both house wrap and roof underlayment. These panels provide a superior level of protection against air and water intrusion. ForceField Panels help to keep water out without affecting the permeability of the panel itself, allowing water vapor to escape and promote drying. - Consist of structural sheathing with a water-resistive overlay - Install easily like standard OSB or plywood sheathing - Exceptional drainage capability - Work with accessories to help keep builds dry and energy efficient - Ideal for walls and sloped roofs in residential, multifamily and light commercial construction",
