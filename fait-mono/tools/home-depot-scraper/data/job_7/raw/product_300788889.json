    "description": "These stainless steel Flat head screws are ideal for exterior wood-to-wood applications such as decks, fences, and other outdoor projects. They are sold in a 5 lb. box (approx. 840 screws). Star recess provides consistent, reliable performance. The Flat head design provides better holding power in wood-to-wood applications. The Type 17 point means you don't need to pre-drill the wood before you drive in the screws in most common wood species. 305 stainless steel offers exceptional corrosion-resistance and high-tensile strength and durability, ideal for load-bearing applications such as decks. These features eliminate staining or streaking around fastener heads when used with cedar, redwood, mahoganies, and wood composites. Grabber screws begin with the best available materials and conform to strict manufacturing requirements with less stress during the milling process, resulting in a stronger screw. Grabber screws use the highest quality cold heading SAE 1022 steel wire, which forms stronger, superior heads and threads for consistent screws that are less likely to break or bend. This means fewer wasted screws. Drive more screws in less time with a cleaner, smoother finish and less waste. That's the Grabber value. Available in variety of lengths.",
