    "description": "Wall art panels are made with a new generation of wood material, which reproduces a 350-year old structure of wood on a molecular level. We use our patented thermo-treatment technology to speed up the aging of the wood. If you compare the cell structure of 350-year old wood with the thermo-treated wood (see in the picture), you'll see that they are similar. So, we make a real 350-year old wood with our process, but it is a new product! Easy Planking wall art panels add character, warmth, and a rustic feel to any residential or commercial wall decor. In opposite to reclaimed lumber, which was staying outdoors for decades, our product is free of any insects and bacteria. Change the look of any room by adding the natural beauty of wood to your home or office decor. Easy Planking wall art panels are a real old-wood product, which creates a unique design solution for reclaimed lumber as wall decals or old-wood fashion interior styles. Use our wall art panels as a wall accent, picture frames, a substrate for collections of pictures, musical discs, photos, or any objects. Due to thermo-treatment of wood, use Easy Planking wall art panels even in bathrooms and in other high humidity areas.",

      "The product is made from American hardwood in the USA",
      "Thermo-treatment makes wood dimensionally stable and durable",
      "The wood has a walnut-like brown color throughout wood and treated with different colors and designs",
      "Thermo-treatment gives the wood a Class B Fire Rated (better than non-treated wood, which is rated as a Class C)",

      "WellDone oak decks are priced at the same level as composite decks, cheaper than exotic, and more expensive than pressure-treated pine decks",
      "WellDone oak is a natural wood and can be installed in the same way as any wood deck (screws, clips), oiling is strongly recommended - see installation instruction for details",
