    "description": "This sturdy and durable 2 x 4 in. (actual size 1.5 x 3.5 in.) railing bracket, made of hard nylon material, stands out with its excellent weight-bearing capacity, corrosion and wear resistance, capable of withstanding wind and rain for years of both indoor and outdoor use. Compared to metal, it is more cost-effective and an ideal choice for building new railings. The bracket is compatible with standard-sized wood and suitable for connecting wooden parts such as wood deck railings, wooden fences, wooden handrails, porch railings, etc. and it's easy to fit slightly larger wood through sanding. The package includes 20 black railing brackets and 120 rust-proof nickel-plated screws. Installation is simple and quick, requiring no complicated assembly, just a few minutes with a drill to securely connect the wood to the brackets. Additionally, the brackets support multi-angle adjustments from 0-180\u00b0, making them perfect for DIY projects in the home or garden, giving them a clean and professional look.",
