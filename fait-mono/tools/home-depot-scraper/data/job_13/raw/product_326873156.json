    "description": "With the Multinautic QPF-495 Aluminum Dock Series, it's easy to reach out to your dream of a dock that fits your needs. This simple Collection lets you combine 5 ft. x 10 ft. dock sections in a straight line, side by side or in an \"L\" shape to adjust to your own design. It's the perfect dock size unit for a light frame assembly that offers a low or a medium freeboard depending on your favorite nautical activities and the specifications of your shoreline. Simply choose Stationary and/or Floating Ensembles with or without Cedar Decking. Each unit is modular, letting you decide of the exact configuration that will suit your precise needs. Combining 3 dock sections or more in a Floating layout will allow mooring up to a 25-ft. long boat. Its sleek and unique designed aluminum frame system allows you to insert your mooring cleats (and other accessories) in the top track, without drilling into your decking, and relocate them where you want. Decking boards can be assembled as panels to be rapidly removed from the sub frame to lighten manipulations seasonally year after year. The included assembly hardware for the frame is all stainless steel or hot dip galvanized. This page presents the 5 ft x 10 ft Aluminum Stationary Dock Kit Model QPF-495 With Cedar Decking, product 21577.",

      "Stationary docks will be good until you reach 4 ft. of water depth. as stated, you might be combining fixed and floating sections depending on the shoreline, a floating dock system must include a semi-floating ramp that you will create with a floating kit",
      "Before your semi-floating ramp, install enough stationary docks sections to reach further out to the deeper waters to the floating area",
      "Included: two 6 ft. HDG steel posts with PVC caps and 6 in. x 6 in. HDG steel base plates, this ingenious plate allows the post to be passed through a hole to be driven into the shoreline or lake bottom and secured in place, preventing it from sinking further",
      "Included lumber for this kit is cedar for its lightweight and its long-lasting characteristics, its natural protection against mold and insects do not require any coating, thus keeping water free from chemicals. Smooth on bare feet",
      "Exact size of this aluminum frame structure is 60 in. x 116 in. x 6.5 in. it includes a pair of hinges that can be installed on the short or the long side, height adjustments of the dock will be made at dock level using the bolts in the corner leg holders",
      "Stationary docks allow the addition of dock wheels (kit 22005) to ease the installation and removal, they also allow rolling the dock to adjust its positioning in or out of the lake in regard to seasonal water level fluctuations",
      "With QPF-495 Multinautic stationary docks, if you acquire a boat in the future, or want to enlarge your configuration, you will be able to add dock floats on these hybrid structures",
      "Aluminum is not suitable for salt water"
