    "description": "Multinautic developed sturdy hardware kits to make it easy for you to build the wood dock of your dreams. Inspired by our challenging customer base of waterfront residents we have designed this Collection of Docks Kits from the most popular sizes. They are composed of our sturdy hot-dipped galvanized steel hardware and the famous foam-filled Eagle Floats allowing you to choose between medium or high freeboard ensembles to fit your favorite nautical activities. Start your layout with a semi-floating section and connect it to one or more floating kits to meet your needs. In shallow waters connect robust leg docks to reach the semi-floating section or create a complete stationary dock layout. To assess your needs consider your neighbors' docks. If they have been installed for a few years and are still in good condition a similar choice may be right for you. Refer to our PLANNING GUIDE available on this page. It could be an L-shaped dock a straight line to reach deeper water or a U-shaped dock to securely moor a boat protected from large waves. From small easy-to-move dock to large floating sections up to 10 ft. x 16 ft. you'll find what works best for your layout. The possibilities are endless. This new Collection will accommodate family and friends to enjoy summer fun to the fullest. For this 5 ft. x 16 ft. High Freeboard Semi-Floating Dock 19377 the required lumber list to get (from homedepot. com or locally) is detailed in the PDF file to download from this webpage.",

      "Kit includes HDG steel hardware for a 5 ft. x 16 ft. dock structure:1/4 in. thick HD structural corner brackets (4x) w/back plates (6x);1/8 in. thick joists corners (2x) w/back plates (4x);1/4 in. thick HD leg holders (2x);1/2 in. and 3/8 in. carriage bolts",
      "Also included: 2x 3 ft. HDG steel posts with PVC caps and 6 in. x 6 in. steel base plates, this ingenious plate let a post through a hole, to be driven into shore ground or lake bottom, then secured in place, preventing it from sinking deeper",
      "Floating dock installation requires a semi-floating dock section for a smooth transition between the shore or a stationary dock, see planning guide for info",
      "Semi-floating dock height will match with a high freeboard floating dock layout, it includes two 16 in. foam filled floats (24 in. W x 48 in. L) with 540 lbs. of buoyancy each, HDG lag bolts and large flat washers are included for a safe installation",
      "Manufactured in the United States by hendren plastics, Eagle Floats exceed all the marine industry standards for encapsulated dock flotation using cutting edge technology: infrared telemetry - computer controlled steaming",
      "Suggested lumber size for this kit is 2 in. x 6 in. for a sturdy dock that will be light enough to ease installation, but you can also make 2 in. x 8 in. sub structure for demanding location, download the pdf file for the material list to get locally or online",
      "Pair of dock hinges, kit 19133 can be purchase separately to connect this semi-floating dock to a stationary or a floating dock and it is recommended to combine these hinges with the inside corners brackets",
      "If this semi-floating dock kit is to be installed as a stand-alone dock or just connected to a stationary dock, get the chain retainer dock kit 19111 to secure it from lateral movements with chains, see the anchoring suggestions in the planning guide",
      "Dock floats have a 15-year limited warranty, and our hot-dipped galvanized hardware has a limited lifetime warranty"
