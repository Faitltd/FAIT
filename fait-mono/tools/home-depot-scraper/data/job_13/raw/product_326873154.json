    "description": "With the Multinautic QPF-495 Aluminum Dock Series, it's easy to reach out to your dream of a dock that fits your needs. This simple Collection lets you combine 5 ft. x 10 ft. dock sections in a straight line, side by side or in an L shape to adjust to your own design. It's the perfect dock size unit for a light frame assembly that offers a low or a medium freeboard depending on your favorite nautical activities and the specifications of your shoreline. Simply choose Stationary and/or Floating Ensembles with or without Cedar Decking. Each unit is modular, letting you decide the exact configuration that will suit your precise needs. Combining 3 dock sections or more in a Floating layout will allow mooring of up to a 25 ft. long boat. Its sleek and unique designed aluminum frame system allows you to insert your mooring cleats (and other accessories) in the top track, without drilling into your decking - and relocate them where you want. Decking boards can be assembled as panels to be rapidly removed from the sub frame to lighten manipulations year after year for seasonal removal. The included assembly hardware for the frame is all stainless steel or hot dip galvanized. This page presents the 5 ft. x 10 ft. Aluminum Stationary Dock Kit Model QPF-495 Without Cedar Decking, product 21576.",
