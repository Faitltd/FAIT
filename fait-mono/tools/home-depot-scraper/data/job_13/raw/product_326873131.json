    "description": "This page presents the 5 ft. x 10 ft. Medium Freeboard Aluminum Floating Dock Kit Model QPF-495 without Cedar Decking, product 21568. With its medium freeboard of roughly 16 in. above water, you will easily board a boat from this dock. With the Multinautic QPF-495 Aluminum Dock Series, reaching out to your dream of a dock that fits your needs is easy. This simple Collection lets you combine 5 ft. x 10 ft. dock sections in a straight line, side by side or in an ''L'' shape to adjust to your design. It's the perfect dock size unit for a light frame assembly that offers a low or a medium freeboard depending on your favorite nautical activities and the specifications of your shoreline. Simply choose Stationary and/or Floating Ensembles with or without Cedar Decking. Each unit is modular, letting you decide of the exact configuration that will suit your precise needs. The combination of 3 or more dock sections in a basic Floating layout (stationary plus semi-floating plus floating) allows you to moor a boat of up to 25 ft. long. Its sleek and unique designed aluminum frame system allows you to insert your mooring cleats (and other accessories) in the top track, without drilling into your decking and relocate them where you want. Decking boards can be assembled as panels to be rapidly removed from the sub frame to lighten manipulations year after year. The included assembly hardware for the frame is all stainless steel or hot dip galvanized.",
