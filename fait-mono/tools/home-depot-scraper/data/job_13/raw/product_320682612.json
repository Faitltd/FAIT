    "description": "Multinautic developed sturdy hardware kits to make it easy for you to build the wood dock of your dreams. Inspired by our challenging customer base of waterfront residents we have designed this Collection of Docks Kits from the most popular sizes. They are composed of our sturdy hot-dipped galvanized steel hardware and the famous foam-filled Eagle Floats, allowing you to choose between medium or high freeboard ensembles to fit your favorite nautical activities. Start your layout with a semi-floating section and connect it to one or more floating kits to meet your needs. In shallow waters connect robust leg docks to reach the semi-floating section or create a complete stationary dock layout. To assess your needs, consider your neighbors' docks. If they have been installed for a few years and are still in good condition, a similar choice may be right for you. Refer to our PLANNING GUIDE available on this page. It could be an L-shaped dock, a straight line to reach deeper water, or a U-shaped dock to securely moor a boat, protected from large waves. From small, easy-to-move dock to large floating sections up to 10 ft. x 16 ft. you'll find what works best for your layout. The possibilities are endless. This new Collection will accommodate family and friends to enjoy summer fun to the fullest. For this 4 ft. x 16 ft. Medium Freeboard Semi-Floating Dock, 19374, the required lumber list to get (from homedepot.com or locally) is detailed in the PDF file to download from this webpage.",

      "10 commercial grade dock floats, 24 in. L x 48 in. W x 12 in. H (380 lbs. buoyancy), will create a medium freeboard of roughly 16 in. above water good for kayak, canoe as well as motorized PWC, HDG lag bolts and large washers are included for safe installation",
      "Manufactured in the United States by hendren plastics, Eagle Floats exceed all the marine industry standards for encapsulated dock flotation using cutting edge technology: infrared telemetry - computer controlled steaming",
      "Suggested lumber size for this kit is 2 in. x 6 in. for a sturdy dock that will be light enough to ease installation while 2 in. x 8 in. is appropriate for a demanding location, see the image and the, pdf file for the material list to get locally or online",
      "Floating dock needs anchor chains to stay in place, this dock kit includes a pair of heavy-duty chain retainers, download our installation guide for more details and to evaluate your specific needs, anchoring materials will be purchased in your area",
      "To connect 2 dock sections, get a pair of HD hinges (19133 sold sepa), we provide 2 extra back plates in case your layout design doesn't allow combination with the big steel corners, in that case, get 1/2 in. x 3 in. carriage bolt kit (22276 8/pk sold sepa)",
      "Dock floats have a 15-year limited warranty, and our hot-dipped galvanized hardware has a limited lifetime warranty"
