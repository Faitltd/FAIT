    "description": "With the Multinautic QPF-495 Aluminum Dock Series, it's easy to reach out to your dream of a dock that fits your needs. This simple Collection lets you combine 5 ft. x 10 ft. dock sections in straight line, side by side or in \"L\" shape to adjust to your own design. It's the perfect dock size unit for a light frame assembly that offers a low or a medium freeboard depending on your favorite nautical activities and the specifications of your shoreline.Simply choose Stationary and/or Floating Ensembles with or without Cedar Decking. Each unit is modular, letting you decide of the exact configuration that will suit your precise needs. Combining 3 dock sections or more in a Floating layout will allow mooring up to 25 ft. long boat.Its sleek and unique designed aluminum frame system allows you to insert your mooring cleats (and other accessories) in the top track, without drilling into your decking, and relocate them where you want. Decking boards can be assembled as panels to be rapidly removed from the sub frame to lighten manipulations year after year. The included assembly hardware for the frame is all stainless steel or hot dip galvanized.",

      "As stated, you might be combining Fixed and Floating sections depending on the shoreline. A Floating dock system must include a Semi-floating ramp that you will create with a Floating kit. Stationary docks will be good until you reach 4 ft. of water depth",
      "For a stable Floating dock layout, transform one Floating dock kit into a Semi-floating dock using only 2 of the 3 supplied floats. Switch the 3rd float to a second Floating dock for a total of 4. All following dock sections will have 3 floats each",
      "Before your Semi-floating ramp, install enough Stationary docks to reach further out to the deeper waters to the Floating area. To start a layout with a Semi-floating dock, get short posts (#11007) to connect it to shore as a complement to anchor chains",
      "This medium freeboard floating dock unit comes with three 24 in. L x 60 in. W x 12 in. H foam filled dock floats, with 500 lbs of buoyancy each. Long hexagonal bolts with super-sized flat washers are included for their safe installation",
      "Exact size of this Aluminum frame structure is 60 in. x 116 in. x 6.5 in. It includes a pair of hinges that can be installed on the short or the long side. Multiple-units dock can be made to create a \"U\" shape that will protect your boat from strong waves",
      "Included lumber for this kit is cedar for its lightweight and its long-lasting characteristics. Its natural protection against mold and insects do not require any coating, thus keeping water free from chemicals. Smooth on barefoot, practically no splinter",
      "A floating dock needs anchor chains to stay in place. This dock kit includes a chain hook. Download the ASSEMBLY AND INSTALLATION GUIDE for details and to evaluate your specific needs. Anchoring materials will be purchased in your area. Getting 2 docks will give you the requested pair to anchor the dock layout",
      "Use the Junction Stabilizers to join 2 Floating docks sections that will not bend at junction on a straight layout or to make a stable 10 ft. x 10 ft. platform at the end of the dock system and even create a separate swimming raft for the kids. As for the anchor chain hooks, this ensemble includes one section of Junction Stabilizers. Getting two docks will give you the requested pair to unify two dock sections",
      "Manufactured in the United States by Hendren Plastics, Eagle Floats exceed all the marine industry standards for encapsulated dock flotation using cutting edge technology: infrared telemetry - computer controlled streaming",
      "Aluminum is not suitable for salt water"
