    "description": "If you love the look of birch plywood but not the price a more affordable, great-looking option is BCX plywood. Use BCX for DIY projects such as shelving, hobbies, small repairs and home decor projects. Use for larger projects such as stairs, exterior wall sheathing, paneling, soffits, underlayment for siding materials, the support structure for cabinets and other built-ins and much more. Exceptionally versatile BCX panels are manufactured to meet or exceed the performance standards set forth by the Engineered Wood Association PS 1-09 standard for veneer grade, glue and bond durability, thickness requirements, finished tolerances, testing procedures and identification and stamping guidelines.
