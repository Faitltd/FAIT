    "description": "The FastenMaster Cortex Hidden Fastening System is the fastest, easiest way to hide fasteners in composite, cap stock, and PVC decking boards. Cortex offers a strong connection between the deck board and joist. It hides fasteners across the entire deck, first and last board, perimeter and stairs.Cortex plugs are made with the same material as leading deck boards, meaning you can achieve a perfect seamless finish across your whole deck. Once installed, Cortex plugs become a part of your deck, expanding and contracting along with the boards around them - this means your plugs will not need to be replaced for the lifetime of the project. Featuring a TORX ttap drive system and a high-strength setting tool - Cortex screws are easy to install and optimized for use by the PRO contractor. The plugs come pre-aligned on a collated strip, eliminating the need to fumble around with loose plugs and making installation 50% faster.The Spotter Lid Installation Guide enables you to position your fasteners perfectly on the scalloped Trex Enhance boards.To install, simply drive the Cortex fastener using the included setting tool - this will countersink the screw to the perfect depth. Then, place your Cortex plugs on top of the fastener holes with the grains aligned, and tap to finish.Designed to fasten 100 lineal feet of Trex Enhance Saddle decking. Includes 224, 2-1/2 inch carbon steel Cortex decking screws, 240 collated Cortex plugs and 2 Cortex setting tools.",
