    "description": "The FastenMaster Cortex Hidden Fastening System for Fascia is the fastest, easiest way to hide the heads of your screws when installing fascia or stair risers.Cortex plugs are made with the same material as Trex fascia boards, meaning you can achieve a perfect seamless finish across your whole deck. Once installed, Cortex plugs become a part of your fascia board, expanding and contracting along with the boards around them - this means your plugs will not need to be replaced for the lifetime of the project. Featuring a TORX ttap drive system and a high-strength setting tool - Cortex screws are easy to install and optimized for use by the PRO contractor.Using the included Cortex Fascia Counter-Boring bit, drill an oversized pilot hole - the bit leaves the perfect amount of space for both the screw and plug. Then, use the Cortex setting tool to drive the flat headed Cortex screw the perfect depth. Finally, place your Cortex plug in the screw hole with the grains aligned and tap to finish.FastenMaster recommends installing 3 fasteners every 18 inches on 12 inch fascia boards, and 2 fasteners every 18 inches on 8 inch fascia boards. Consult your board manufacturer's installation instructions before starting your project.Designed to fasten 50 lineal feet of Transcend Island Mist Fascia. Includes 100, 1-3/4 inch carbon steel Cortex fascia screws, 105 Cortex Fascia plugs, 1 Cortex Counterbore Tool, and 1 Cortex setting tool.",
