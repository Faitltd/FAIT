    "description": "The FastenMaster Collated Cortex Hidden Fastening System is the fastest, easiest way to hide fasteners in composite, cap stock, and PVC decking boards. Cortex offers a strong connection between the deck board and joist. It hides fasteners across the entire deck, first and last board, perimeter and stairs. Cortex plugs are made with the same material as leading deck boards, meaning you can achieve a perfect seamless finish across your whole deck. Once installed, Cortex plugs become a part of your deck, expanding and contracting along with the boards around them - this means your plugs will not need to be replaced for the lifetime of the project. Featuring a TORX ttap drive system and a high-strength setting tool - Cortex screws are easy to install and optimized for use by the PRO contractor. Cortex plugs come pre-aligned on collated strips, enabling you to install Cortex 50% faster. To install, simply drive the Cortex fastener using the included setting tool - this will countersink the screw to the perfect depth. Then, place your Cortex plugs on top of the fastener holes with the grains aligned, and tap to finish. Designed to fasten 50 lineal feet of Veranda Stone Gray Decking. Includes 75, 2-1/2 in. carbon steel Cortex decking screws, 80 Cortex plugs on collated strips, and 1 Cortex setting tool. A winner of the 2022 Home Depot Innovation Award, Cortex is trusted by PROs everywhere who are dedicated to craftsmanship and quality.",
