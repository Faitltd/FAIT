    "description": "The FastenMaster Collated Cortex Hidden Fastening System for PVC Trim is the fastest, easiest way to hide trim fasteners in PVC Trim. Features TORX ttap Drive System which is almost impossible to strip-out and the deck fastener is easily removed. The stability button keeps the fastener straight through installation.Cortex plugs are made with the same material as leading trim boards, meaning you can achieve a perfect seamless finish every time. Once installed, Cortex plugs become a part of your trim board, expanding and contracting along with the boards around them - this means your plugs will not need to be replaced for the lifetime of the project. The plugs come pre-aligned on a collated strip, eliminating the need to fumble around with loose plugs and making installation 50% faster.To install, simply drive the Cortex fastener using the included setting tool - this will countersink the screw to the perfect depth. Then, place your Cortex plugs on top of the fastener holes with the grains aligned, and tap to finish.Designed to fasten 250 lineal feet of Veranda Smooth Trim. Includes 375, 2 inch carbon steel Cortex trim screws, 400 collated Cortex plugs and 1 Cortex setting tool.Cortex is trusted by PROs everywhere who are dedicated to craftsmanship and quality.",
