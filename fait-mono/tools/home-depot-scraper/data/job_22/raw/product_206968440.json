    "description": "Pressure-Treated Pine meets the highest grading standards for strength and appearance. This double treated Ground Contact lumber must be used for applications where treated lumber is difficult to maintain, repair or replace. Treated lumber is critical to the performance and safety of an entire system or construction such as deck joists, beams and ledger boards. An additional benefit of treated lumber is its defense against rot and insect infestation for its vast majority of applications. Southern yellow pine is responsibly manufactured, safe, and environmentally friendly when used as directed.Treated wood is typically still wet when it's delivered to The Home Depot or job site. As it dries, you should expect slight changes in width and length. As lumber dries, it may split, cup and warp. This is more likely to occur to occur in lower-grade boards, where knots and uneven grains are already present. Each piece of lumber is unique and carries physical characteristics that may include the following: knots, warping, shrinkage, swelling and/or splitting.",
