Use as a centerpiece to display vases, bouquets, candles, or mason jars with fresh wildflowers. These slices are cut, kiln dried, and left un-sanded for a natural, rustic feel. These pieces may also have natural imperfections such as small cracks, loose or removed pieces of bark, blemishes, or knots. Feature an unsanded surface and a refined sanded surface. The refined surface opens the door to new applications such as painting, woodburning, decoupage, and other crafts.",
