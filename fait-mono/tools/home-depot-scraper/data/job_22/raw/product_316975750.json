    "description": "The latest generation of Trex Enhance Decking, the Basics Collection offers homeowners high-performance, low-maintenance composite decking at a value that makes it an attractive option for any project. Trex Enhance is a perfect choice for those who want to enjoy the look of real wood without the time-consuming maintenance. Made of recycled materials, so you can feel good about a deck that is earth-friendly and a 'green' option. Available in classic Enhance colors: Beach Dune, Clam Shell and Saddle. The second generation of Trex Enhance comes with a new, lighter, scalloped profile for easier handling and installation. The new profile means these boards won't work with deck plugs, as a cocktail or top rail and can not be curved or bent.",
