    "description": "WellDone Premium Ash decks are made from thermally modified lumber with no chemicals added. Due to thermo-modification, wood becomes naturally durable for at least 25 years. In the process, wood changes its molecular structure and becomes similar to 350-year lumber.Thermally treated WellDone natural Ash decking is highly superior to any other decking material in the market. It is a 100% Green product with all the advantages of natural wood.In addition to natural durability, thermo-modification makes wood repeal moisture on a molecular level, dramatically reducing the boards' shrinking and swelling. The thermo-treatment process also prevents wood from cupping and surface checking, which increases the product's maintenance interval.Our decks come factory-oiled with UV protection on all 4-sides. The factory oiling saves a lot of costs as no oiling is needed after installation.The thermo-treatment process enhances the color of the wood, creating an even brown tint consistent beyond the surface. Chemicals are never used during thermo-treatment, so the material remains environmentally safe. You and your children can walk barefoot across a thermo-treated Ash deck with certainty and peace of mind that the surface is free from harmful chemicals.",
