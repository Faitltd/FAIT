    "description": "The LRUZ offers an economic alternative for those applications requiring a sloped hanger for rafter-to-ridge connections. Used with solid sawn rafters, the LRUZ's unique design enables the hanger to be installed either before or after the rafter is in place. The field-adjustable seat helps improve job efficiency by eliminating mismatched angles in the field and lead times associated with special orders. The LRUZ offers comparable or better load capacity to other rafter hangers at a reduced cost while using fewer fasteners.",
