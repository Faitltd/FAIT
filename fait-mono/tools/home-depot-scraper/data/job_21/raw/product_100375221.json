    "description": "The CCQ is designed to provide strong column-beam connections in wood construction. The seat of the column cap provides an additional surface area of bearing that extends beyond each side of the column. The extended bearing surface helps distribute the load from the beam and provide support for the connection. The CCQ uses Strong-Drive SDS Heavy-Duty Connector screws for fast installation and to attach to a greater net section area of the column than a bolt attachment normally entails.",
