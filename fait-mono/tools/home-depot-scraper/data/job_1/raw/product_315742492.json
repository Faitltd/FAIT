    "description": "The TOTO UltraMax II One-Piece Elongated 1.28 GPF ADA Comfort Height Toilet with CEFIONTECT features a sleek, one-piece design that will immediately beautify the appearance of your bathroom. UltraMax II features TOTO's tornado flush, a hole-free rim design with dual-nozzles that creates a centrifugal washing action that assists in rinsing the bowl more efficiently. This version of the TOTO UltraMax II includes CEFIONTECT, a layer of exceptionally smooth glaze that prevents particles from adhering to the ceramic. This feature, coupled with tornado flush, assists to reduce the frequency of toilet cleanings, minimizing the usage of water, harsh chemicals, and time required for cleaning. The one-piece design is not only aesthetically pleasing, but also offers the benefit of being easier to clean versus a two-piece toilet. By removing the gap between the tank and bowl, we eliminate the hiding place for dirt and debris. An additional benefit of the one-piece toilet is that there is no threat of leaks from bolts or gaskets that can occur in two-piece toilets. This version of the UltraMax II offers TOTO T40 Washlet compatibility for when you are ready to upgrade. Washlet toilets feature a channel on the bowl surface to help conceal your Washlet supply line and power cord for seamless integration. The TOTO UltraMax II is designed in TOTO's Universal Height, which allows for a more comfortable seat position across a wide range of users.",
