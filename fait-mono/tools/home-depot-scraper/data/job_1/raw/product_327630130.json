    "description": "Our Impero Prestige White 24 x 48 porcelain tile is a contemporary marble look of warm gray and beige veins intertwining throughout the luminous white background.

This high-performance marble-effect porcelain tile is resistant to wear and stains. This tile also offers an ease to cleaning and sanitizing using common household detergents.",
    "feature_bullets": [
      "The timeless appearance of white marble with bold gray veining",
      "Ideal for floors, walls, backsplashes, showers and countertops",

      "15.50 sq. ft./Case; 2 Tiles/Case; 55.15 lbs./Case",
      "24 in. width x 48 in. length x 0.325 in. thick",
      "Large size (24 in. x 48 in.) offers an impressive result - less grout to clean and faster installation.",
      "Grade 1, first-quality porcelain tile for floors and walls of tremendous aesthetic impact, characterized by spectacular contrasts of light and shadow sculpted by an elegant lighting that exalts or softens the surface depth.",
      "Glazed, smooth finish with low sheen and moderate variation in tone.",
      "Suitable for both residential and commercial use.",
      "Class 4 abrasion resistance (medium to heavy traffic) - suitable for all residential applications (both walls and floors), as well as medium commercial and light institutional locations.",
      "Truly waterproof - porcelain flooring has water absorption of less than 0.5%, and it is suitable for indoor or outdoor use.",
      "Completely frost resistant for indoor and outdoor applications. We recommend using a modified thin set when outdoor, according to the manufacturer.",
      "It is recommended you purchase a minimum of 10% overage to account for design cuts and patterns. Before you begin an installation, familiarize yourself with cost factors. This Project Cost Guide can assist you in budgeting for your tile project.",
      "Slip resistance DCOF greater than or equal to 0.42 - all Corso Italia tiles meet ANSI requirements for use on level interior or exterior floors expected to be walked upon when wet (not recommended for outdoor wet areas such as pools, where we recommend higher slip resistance - check out Corso Italia porcelain pavers).",
      "Please ensure that all tile needed for a project is obtained within 1 order - multiple orders can result in receiving multiple dye lots and/or calibers, related to different production batches, which may slightly vary.",
      "Overlap during installation should not exceed 33% (a third of the tile length), 50% overlap not recommended.",
      "Made from natural ingredients, free from allergens, VOCs, formaldehyde and PVC. It is naturally inhospitable to bacteria and stain resistant - regular household cleaning will keep surface clean and sanitized.",
      "All online orders for this item ship via parcel ground and may arrive in multiple boxes."
