    "description": "The main function of the 21 in. H toilet is to provide a more comfortable sitting posture, making using the toilet easier and more convenient. This kind of modern toilet design is usually suitable for the elderly, people with physical disabilities or taller people, because regular height toilets are not comfortable or convenient enough to use. In addition, high toilets can also help reduce knee and joint pressure when squatting, which may be more popular for people recovering from joint diseases or sports injuries.",
