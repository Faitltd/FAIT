    "description": "The beauty and warmth of natural hardwood shines through on these PureBond Red Oak Plywood panels from Columbia Forest Products. Assembled using a soy-based PureBond technology, these 3/4 in. x 4 ft. x 8 ft. sheets feature American-grown timber throughout with decorative red oak face and back veneers that produce stellar results on DIY woodworking projects. Using a proper saw blade, these sheets can be custom-cut to suit an assortment of carpentry applications, including construction of furniture, shelves, bookcases, built-in cabinets, media centers, headboards and more. This formaldehyde-free plywood is a cost-competitive alternative to potentially health-hazardous UF boards that may release air-degrading fumes over time. It's as exquisite and robust as solid hardwood but without the expense and heft.",
