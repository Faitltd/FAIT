This toilet features patented hydraulic technology, known as the Stealth. 1 flush thoroughly evacuates the bowl every time and eliminates double flushing. This toilet has achieved a quiet, powerful and proven flush, saving thousands of gallons with no change in consumer use or behavior. The flapper-less design means no costly flapper, chains or levers to replace and no leaks ever. Also, this toilet virtually eliminates all refill noise as the fill valve is never exposed. Quiet, slow-close seat included.",
