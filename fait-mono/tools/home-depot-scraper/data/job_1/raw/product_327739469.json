    "description": "Use this PureBond Birch Plywood Project Panel for your next cabinetry or furniture project and never worry about it releasing airborne contaminants, as formaldehyde-laden products are prone to do. A decorative birch veneer graces the face of this 3-ply panel, assembled on top of 2 other veneers with a soy-based PureBond technology that is environmentally friendly and won't off-gas toxic fumes like UF plywood. The natural warmth and beauty of real birch gives the decorative face veneer a splendid appearance that forms the foundation for impressive DIY creations, such as serving trays, end tables, pet food centers, footstools, wall pockets, shelves and more. It's a cost-competitive alternative to products that may degrade indoor air quality over time and its water resistance further strengthens its endurance for lasting performance.",
