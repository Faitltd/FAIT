    "description": "Shark Tooth Heavy-Duty Matting offer superior wear life and durability because these floor and equipment protector mats are designed for high impact applications and abrasive conditions. These thick floor mats are created from recycled tire crumbs and polymer binders. Inheriting the durability and weather resistant capabilities from tires, this recycled mat is ideal for inside and outside applications. With a high content of EPDM, Shark Tooth heavy duty matting provide excellent UV and ozone resistance as outdoor mats. At a 3/4 in. thickness, this thick rubber tile reduces noise, contains vibration, absorbs shock, adds comfort, and prevents fatigue from standing for long durations. Rubber has a naturally high coefficient of friction ensuring that this product provides unmatched traction to avoid any accidental falls. In case of a fall, these heavy-duty mats offer a layer of cushion to help avert any serious injuries. The resiliency of the recycled mat helps to relieve stress on joints, unlike hard concrete floors. Shark Tooth mats are available in three sizes to best fit your space: 2 ft. x 3 ft., 3 ft. x 4 ft., and 4 ft. x 6 ft. With a weight of 4 lbs. per square foot, these heavy-duty mats can stay down under their own weight any extra adhesives. This allows for this floor protector mat to be modular for any temporary installation in spots. Shark Tooth mats are durable thick floor mats that are ideal for a multitude of applications.",
