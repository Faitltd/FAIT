    "description": "Pressure-Treated Southern Yellow Pine meets the highest grading standards for strength and appearance. This treated Ground Contact plywood must be used for applications where treated plywood is difficult to maintain, repair or replace. Treated lumber is critical to the performance and safety of an entire system or construction such as deck joists, beams and ledger boards. An additional benefit is its defense against rot and insect infestation for its vast majority of applications. Southern yellow pine is responsibly manufactured, safe and environmentally friendly when used as directed.",
