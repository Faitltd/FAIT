    "description": "Each 7-ply sheet features decorative poplar veneers on the face and back, which exhibit the warmth and beauty of natural hardwood to supply your carpentry creations with visual allure. Furthermore, the 3/4 in. x 4 ft. x 8 ft. panels are manufactured with a soy-based PureBond technology that is formaldehyde-free so it won't deteriorate air quality, as is common with UF-constructed sheets that are susceptible to releasing airborne contaminants over time. Intended for interior use, these poplar plywood panels are an affordable way to craft authentic hardwood-faced masterpieces such as built-in cabinets, entertainment centers, tables, shelves, headboards, wall panels and more.",

      "PureBond hardwood plywood is an environmentally friendly, cost-competitive alternative to panels manufactured with urea formaldehyde (UF), which may degrade air quality over time",
      "7-ply hardwood plywood panel is assembled with decorative poplar veneer",
      "Contains 100% natural wood bonded with a food-grade soy-based adhesive that does not emit toxic air contaminants",
      "Decorative top and bottom veneers, measuring approximately 1/39 in. thick, exhibit the beauty and timeless quality of natural hardwood and are suitable for painting or staining",
      "Water-resistant composition has a higher moisture tolerance than UF panels and is less likely to warp than solid wood",
      "Allow panel to acclimate to interior climate conditions for several days before customizing - for interior applications only",
      "For best cutting results, use an 80-tooth (or greater) table saw blade intended for sheet goods or a carbide-tipped circular saw plywood blade",
      "Common: 3/4 in. x 4 ft. x 8 ft., actual: 0.703 in. x 48 in. x 96 in.",
