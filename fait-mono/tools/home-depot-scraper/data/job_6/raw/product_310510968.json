    "description": "Wood decks are susceptible to mold, decay and insects, and have a shorter lifespan. Fiberon composite decking retains its good looks year after year because it's formulated to last. The composite core combines recycled wood with the resilience of recycled plastic, while our proprietary PermaTech cap layer provides superior stain and fade resistance. The result is durable decking that resists splintering, rotting, cracking, insects and decay, with warranties up to 50 years.",
